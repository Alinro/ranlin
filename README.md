## What is this

This is a small web application that on a page generates random links to itself. Useless on its own, but useful for testing a future crawling and scraping library.

## How to use

1. Install Node.js (tested with Node 20.3)
1. Clone repository
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`
1. (Optional) Configure the number of links and link length in `.env`
1. Start local development environment with `npm run dev`
